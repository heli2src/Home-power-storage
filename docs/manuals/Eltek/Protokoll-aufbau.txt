Yes, BMS controls the flatpack. Now on final stages of firmware.
The UART-CAN converter is a nice project on it's own, completely isolated, powered only from one side, also sub-100µA power consumption in standby mode
(while still listening to CAN bus). So it can be used as a generic converter, not just for Eltek.
The protocol is based on information that we got from Eltek. Basically, from what developer told me, it is not that far from what is published on this thread.

Yes, currently it's a limitation, you have to disconnect bluetooth to connect CAN adapter. There will be a firmware to allow CAN adapter connection to other pins.





CanID 0x05014004 + (Status data as previously described) then it is operating normally

CanID 0x05014008 + (Status data as previously described) then it has a warning - remmie got this when in current limit mode which is a warning.

CanID 0x0501400C + (Status data as previously described) then it has an alarm. remmie got this when mains failed which is an alarm.

CanID 0x05014010 + (Status data as previously described) then it is in Walk in mode (as previously described).

If you then send the rectifier

CanID 0x0501BFFC + data 0x08, 0x04, 0x00,

it will send you back

CanID 0x0501BFFC + data 0x0E, 0x04, 0x00, 0xYY, 0xZZ, 0x00, 0x00
where each bit of YY relates to the following WARNINGS
80 = Current limit
40 = low temp
20 = High temp
10 = Low Mains
08 = High Mains
04 = Mod Fail Secondary
02 = Mod Fail Primary
01 = OVS Lock Out
and each bit of the of ZZ relates to the following WARNINGS
80 = Inner Volt
40 = Fan3 Speed low
20 = Sub Mod1 fail
10 = Fan2 Speed low
08 = Fan1 Speed low
04 = Mod Fail Secondary
02 = Module fail
01 = Internal Voltage

if you send CanID 0x0501BFFC + data 0x08, 0x08, 0x00

it will send you back

CanID 0x0501BFFC + data 0x0E, 0x08, 0x00, 0xYY, 0xZZ, 0x00, 0x00

where each bit of YY relates to the following ALARMS
80 = Current limit
40 = low temp
20 = High temp
10 = Low Mains
08 = High Mains
04 = Mod Fail Secondary
02 = Mod Fail Primary
01 = OVS Lock Out
and each bit of ZZ relates to the following ALARMS
80 = Inner Volt
40 = Fan3 Speed low
20 = Sub Mod1 fail
10 = Fan2 Speed low
08 = Fan1 Speed low
04 = Mod Fail Secondary
02 = Module fail
01 = Internal Voltage

I don't think all the warnings and alarms are relevant to all rectifiers but it will help you to find out what is going on if the rectifier sends you a CanID 0x05014008 or 0x0501400C.

I have also found ways to get other status info like firmware versions, max current, max voltage, converter part number, converter type etc but these are not that interesting.


Would anyone know how you can individually control the rectifiers or turn the output off on a specific rectifier? Remmie has showed how 
to send a broadcast to all rectifiers using canID 0x5FF4004, but I want to be able to control individual rectifiers and turn their output off if not required.
